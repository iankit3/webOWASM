#BODY
The Art of writing a fast and performant web application is quite limited due to sheer ability of Web technologies especially JavaScript to using all available  CPU cores.
 JavaScript being the language of Web is quite popular and easy to approach. Though this comes at a cost of limitations that the language has built in.

__EXPLAIN WHY JS cannot.. It has Single Thread__
Why didn't it had multi-threading from day one.
The language was built in some 14 days and was to designed to be easy and approachable. And just to reiterate a well established notion 
 >Writing a multi-threaded code is hard.
